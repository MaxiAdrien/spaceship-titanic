# Spaceship Titanic project

Based on Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic

Simple neural network, the dataset is small so I focused on subtle feature engineering
to extract insightful information rather than building complex architectures

Scored 79.7% accuracy on first attempt (#656 on leaderboard). To be improved as follows:
- Implement TODOs in preprocessing.py
- Tune neural network more in depth
- Ensemble neural network with other architectures (e.g. Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
